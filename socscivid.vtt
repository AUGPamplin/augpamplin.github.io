00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:08.096
You get to socialize
and learn about sciences (laughs)

2
00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:09.064
It's social, you know, like

3
00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:13.799
interactions with different people
or different things in society...

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.461
Social science, to me, is
kind of the learning of

5
00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.506
the people and the way they
interact with each other.

6
00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:23.256
You have to be able to understand
how to communicate with humans,

7
00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:24.466
how to work with humans.

8
00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:27.471
Understanding the theory behind it
is incredibly important.

9
00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.144
Just learning about the culture
and society itself,

10
00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:31.854
and understanding society...

11
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:35.324
Social sciences is the study of human behavior

12
00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:37.526
and how we interact with one another and 

14
00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:45.667
To me, the social sciences are all about
using the scientific method

15
00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:49.899
to study human behavior and institutions.

16
00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:53.319
The social sciences are the empirical disciplines

17
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.806
that aim at observing, analyzing, 

18
00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:00.296
and then, of course, sharing knowledge about

19
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.946
various types of and impacts of social interaction.

20
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:07.258
Social science is the study of humans
in all kinds of ways:

21
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.581
politically, economically, socially, culturally...

22
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.501
It manages the government better and makes it
more efficient and effective

23
00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:15.275
because if we do these experiments,

24
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.710
then we can give it back 
to the community and say

25
00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:19.273
this is what's holding you back,

26
00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:20.547
this is how we can make our world better

27
00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:25.618
It has adapted and uses scientific method
to answer research questions 

28
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.746
that are very different from the natural sciences,

29
00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:31.902
but still make great use of that methodology.

30
00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:41.351
By merging together, we'll be able
to interact more with each other.

31
00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:44.482
I think you'll see new, exciting
research coming from that.

32
00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:48.419
I think it's really exciting because
we have a lot of commonality

33
00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:51.861
across the different disciplines,
and it creates a really unique

34
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:56.658
opportunity to collaborate,
to learn from each other.

35
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.244
We'll be able to get our
public administration people

36
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.099
working with our political scientists,
working with our sociologists,

37
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.234
working with our criminologists,

38
00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:04.234
working with our social workers!

39
00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:07.727
For me, it's all about the
connections I make here,

40
00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.462
with the professors.

41
00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.999
I think that's one thing Pamplin is really good at,

42
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.912
having that sense of community,

43
00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:19.681
and combining these two departments
into the Social Sciences department

44
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:23.434
I think is gonna be something
extremely beneficial for students.

45
00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:26.354
I was always told, well, you have to be
a criminal justice major,

46
00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:28.882
oh, you have to be a social work major
to do that.

47
00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.442
Now I won't have that barrier stopping me!

48
00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.154
Students are gonna see a lot of 
new opportunities,

49
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.780
whether that's in class offerings,

50
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.615
potential to get involved in research, 

51
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:41.911
or maybe even new student associations
arising out of that collaboration.

52
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.386
I think it's going to be great for the students,

53
00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:46.744
I think it's going to be great for faculty research

54
00:02:46.744 --> 00:02:50.211
Ideally what we'll do is really strategically

55
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:55.550
organize and sort of work together
to facilitate these collaborations

56
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.051
that have already been happening.

57
00:02:57.051 --> 00:03:00.580
It's really fun to be around so many faculty

58
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.205
who really love our students,
love teaching,

59
00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:05.207
love doing research,

60
00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:09.255
and they're excited to come together
with each other

61
00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:12.325
and the opportunities that they'll have
working with each other,

62
00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.328
and I'm really looking forward to
working with them and working together.
