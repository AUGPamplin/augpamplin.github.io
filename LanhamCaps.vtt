00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.144 align:end line:10%
I think about land a lot. 
In fact, I am possessed by it.

2
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.288 align:middle line:92%
I think about the land as I speed by it on busy interstates. 

3
00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:27.769 align:middle line:92%
Driving at hyperspeed on a four-lane highway 
to someplace better

4
00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.381 align:middle line:92%
leaves very little time
for looking beyond the blurry wall of trees. 

5
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.734 align:middle line:92%
Headed downhill from Upcountry to Low 
the land falls away from the road at the mercy of water: 

6
00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:92%
of creeks, rivers, swamps, marsh, and ultimately the Mother Atlantic.

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.481 align:middle line:92%
Land is somehow always on my mind. 

8
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.635 align:middle line:92%
I think this is because I’m missing the land from which I came; 

9
00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:59.809 align:middle line:92%
the pastures, fields, woods, creeks, and bottoms of my Home Place. 

10
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.398 align:middle line:92%
My obsession is born of the land in Edgefield that nurtured me — 

11
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:08.359 align:middle line:92%
land in the middle of nowhere that meant everything to me. 

12
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:13.156 align:middle line:92%
It is born of growing up on garden-raised vegetables, pasture-fed beef, 

13
00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.408 align:middle line:92%
and the sweet fruits of our own orchards.

14
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.955 align:middle line:92%
It is born of some of the best years of my life.

15
00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.709 align:middle line:92%
It is born of my ancestors' sweat equity.

16
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.589 align:middle line:92%
These ancestors toiled on the land as enslaved, 

17
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:36.096 align:middle line:92%
eventually owning some of it, and then giving away many of its riches 
for pennies on the dollar.

18
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.101 align:middle line:92%
I don’t expect everyone to feel the same way that I do about land.

19
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:92%
For many of us, the scars are still way too fresh. 

20
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.815 align:middle line:92%
Fields of cotton stretching to the horizon --

21
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.318 align:middle line:92%
land worked, sweatland worked, sweated, and suffered over for the profit of others --

22
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.571 align:middle line:92%
shouldn't engender warm feelings among anyone,

23
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.199 align:middle line:92%
least of all, us.

24
00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.786 align:middle line:92%
But the land, in spite of its history, 

25
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.998 align:middle line:92%
still holds hope for making good on the promises we thought it could, 

26
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:07.919 align:middle line:92%
especially if we can somehow reconnect to it.

27
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.133 align:middle line:92%
I believe the reparations lie not in what someone will give me,

28
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.969 align:middle line:92%
but in what I already own.

29
00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.763 align:middle line:92%
I’ve been all over the world, now, 

30
00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:22.851 align:middle line:92%
but my wanderlust seems to always find its way home 

31
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:27.363 align:middle line:92%
to piedmont clay, loblolly pine, and prairie warblers.

32
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:33.069 align:middle line:92%
And though I can't be at the Home Place that used to be,

33
00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.586 align:middle line:92%
I've been lucky.

34
00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:38.158 align:middle line:92%
I do still have land and I think about it often.

35
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.703 align:middle line:92%
I think about quail calling in the pines that I’ve just thinned.

36
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:92%
I think about hunting lovesick turkeys in the alley 
between the cutover and the creek bottom. 

37
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.671 align:middle line:92%
I think about the comfort of eating food 
that comes by my own hand and hard work.

38
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:57.969 align:middle line:92%
I imagine the forty acres and the swayback mules 
so many were promised but never got.

39
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.557 align:middle line:92%
As we write memoir, as we relate place,

40
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:09.022 align:middle line:92%
as we relate faces to those places,
past and present and perhaps future,

41
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.025 align:middle line:92%
I think memoir is an important tool.

42
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.987 align:middle line:92%
And so for me again it's been sort of this constant meditation

43
00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.948 align:middle line:92%
on from whence I came, and so

44
00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:25.205 align:middle line:92%
coming back home to Edgefield, coming back home to
a place that, for most of its history,

45
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle line:92%
was filled with more hate than hope,

46
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:33.671 align:middle line:92%
It's a place that I look at
for the ecological value that it holds...

47
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:39.344 align:middle line:90%
...for what it brought 
my family through, and to, 
to this point.
