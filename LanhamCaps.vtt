00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:32.467
I think about land a lot. 
In fact, I am possessed by it.

2
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.763
I think about the land as I speed by it on busy interstates. 

3
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.813
Driving at hyperspeed on a four-lane highway 
for looking beyond a blurry wall of trees. 
to someplace better leaves very little time

4
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:51.653
Headed downhill from Upcountry to Low 
the land falls away from the road at the mercy of water: 

5
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:57.700
of creeks, rivers, swamps, marsh, and ultimately the Mother Atlantic.

6
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.204
Land is somehow always on my mind. 

7
00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:06.334
I think this is because I’m missing the land from which I came; 

8
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.840
the pastures, fields, woods, creeks, and bottoms of my Home Place. 

9
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.262
My obsession is born of the land in Edgefield that nurtured me — 

10
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:20.932
land in the middle of nowhere that meant everything to me. 

11
00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:25.562
It is born of growing up on garden-raised vegetables, pasture-fed beef, 

12
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:29.149
and the sweet fruits of our own orchards.

13
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.778
It is born of some of the best years of my life.

14
00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.491
It is born of my ancestors' sweat equity.

15
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.287
These ancestors toiled on the land as enslaved, 

16
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:48.168
eventually owning some of it, and then giving away many of its riches 
for pennies on the dollar.

17
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:54.007
I don’t expect everyone to feel the same way that I do about land.

18
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.885
For many of us, the scars are still way too fresh. 

19
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.179
Fields of cotton stretching to the horizon --

20
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.932
land worked, sweatland worked, sweated, and suffered over for the profit of others --

21
00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:06.269
shouldn't engender warm feelings among anyone,

22
00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.646
least of all, us.

23
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.567
But the land, in spite of its history, 

24
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.779
still holds hope for making good on the promises we thought it could, 

25
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.866
especially if we can somehow reconnect to it.

26
00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:25.622
I believe the reparations lie not in what someone will give me,

27
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.666
but in what I already own.

28
00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.502
I’ve been all over the world, now, 

29
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:35.381
but my wanderlust seems to always find its way home 

30
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:40.053
to piedmont clay, loblolly pine, and prairie warblers.

31
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.558
And though I can't be at the Home Place that used to be,

32
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.387
I've been lucky.

33
00:03:47.387 --> 00:03:50.355
I do still have land and I think about it often.

34
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:54.359
I think about quail calling in the pines that I’ve just thinned.

35
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.656
I think about hunting lovesick turkeys in the alley 
between the cutover and the creek bottom. 

36
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:04.410
I think about the comfort of eating food 
that comes by my own hand and hard work.

37
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.617
I imagine the forty acres and the swayback mules 
so many were promised but never got.

38
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.546
<i>As we write memoir, as we relate place,</i>

39
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:19.221
<i>as we relate faces to those places,</i>

40
00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:21.925
<i>past and present and perhaps future,</i>

41
00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:24.629
<i>I think memoir is an important tool.</i>

42
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.752
And so for me again it's been sort of this constant meditation

43
00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:31.579
on from whence I came, and so

44
00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:37.940
<i>coming back home to Edgefield, coming back home to</i>
<i>a place that, for most of its history,</i>

45
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.859
<i>was filled with more hate than hope,</i>

46
00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:46.482
It's a place that I look at
for the ecological value that it holds...

47
00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:52.167
...for what it has brought my family through, and to,
to this point.
