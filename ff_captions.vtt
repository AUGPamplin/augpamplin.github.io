00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.961
[Dean Elna Green:] This is our
very first FutureFest --

2
00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.422
The first annual, because
we're going to keep doing it.

3
00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:07.799
We hope that this is going to be
an opportunity

4
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.344
for students and alumni
to mingle and learn from each other.

5
00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.930
<i>[Assistant Dean Martha Ginn:] Students, if you</i>
<i>want to just come on filing in...</i>

6
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.183
Make sure you get a program on your way in
because that's going to be really important.

7
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:22.022
<i>You have a signature sheet...</i>
<i>You need to meet at least six alumni.</i>

8
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.692
<i>You need to get your six signatures</i>
<i>to turn it into the back table</i>

9
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.569
<i>and you'll get your</i>
<i>Pamplin College t-shirt.</i>

10
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.571
<i>[Deke Copenhaver:] I just say to the students,</i>
<i>you know, </i>

11
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.199
when you're in college, you kind of want to 
figure out what you're going to do

12
00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.785
with the rest of your life, but you really
don't know.

13
00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.705
<i>And there's a reason to get a liberal arts degree.</i>

14
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.708
<i>It gives you experience with a lot of different things.</i>

15
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:46.880
And it's sort of just looking to where you can best
help your community.

16
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:52.010
Well, when they asked me to do it, I thought
it was a great thing, to talk to students.

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.722
Some students wanted to talk about
my Spanish degree, and we talked about

18
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.684
how I was able to teach after that.

19
00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.771
Other students wanted to talk to me
a little more business-wise

20
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.190
<i>about my downtown businesses...</i>

21
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.485
I try to tie it together, you know,
about how I taught first,

22
00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.236
and how that kind of helped me,

23
00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.948
<i>with a real job right after I graduated,</i>
<i>to kind of pursue my dream</i>

24
00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.534
<i>of doing something like the Soul Bar.</i>

25
00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:20.747
<i>I always felt that bringing and having</i>
<i>culture and arts</i>

26
00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.248
brings a quality of life to a city.

27
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.336
I thought it was a cool way to share 
with people

28
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.921
that my degree is in Sociology and 
Criminal Justice,

29
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.469
and I have a job in marketing...

30
00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:40.475
... how varied and how diverse
that Sociology degree really can be.

31
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:45.409
It's important to guide the leaders of tomorrow
because that is our future.

32
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.440
So if I can take any small part

33
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.821
in making sure that we are developing
the kind of leaders that I want,

34
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.114
then I want to do that.
