00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:13.722 align:end line:10%
One of the reasons that I'd left Forsyth County
was that in 1987,

2
00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:14.722 align:middle line:85%
there was a march

3
00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:18.333 align:middle line:85%
to object to the fact that this was
a "white county."

4
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:23.111 align:middle line:85%
At one point there was a church group
who were up on Lake Lanier having a picnic

5
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:27.777 align:middle line:85%
and were set upon by mobs of white people
in the 1980s

6
00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.222 align:middle line:85%
And so there was a march to protest that,

7
00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:85%
led by Hosea Williams and people 
from the King Center

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:85%
and my family were part of that march.

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:85%
My parents were activists;
my dad's a methodist minister.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.458 align:middle line:85%
And they were met by this group.
This is a photograph of that day.

11
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:85%
When I was writing the book,
I thought this would seem less familiar.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.467 align:middle line:85%
Since Charlottesville, the whole country
is more familiar with images like this.

13
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.512 align:middle line:85%
And they came out and chanted
and threw rocks and bottles and bricks.

14
00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:59.893 align:middle line:85%
This is John Lewis and Hosea Williams
leading the Selma March in 1965

15
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.229 align:middle line:85%
just before they are set upon
by Alabama State Troopers.

16
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.984 align:middle line:85%
And there's Hosea in the overalls, in 1987,
twenty-two years later, 

17
00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:14.115 align:middle line:85%
engaged in precisely the same kind of activism
and being set upon by the same kind of mob.

18
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:20.663 align:middle line:85%
So, you have to fast forward about two decades,
and I had fled all of this conflict.

19
00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.082 align:middle line:85%
I had fled Forsyth County.

20
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.583 align:middle line:85%
I was living in New York,

21
00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:85%
and I'd been out to dinner with a friend of mine,
who at the time was another nobody young poet like me.

22
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.549 align:middle line:85%
Her name's Natasha Trethewey.

23
00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.636 align:middle line:85%
And if there are any poetry fans in the room,
she's not a nobody poet anymore.

24
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:40.683 align:middle line:85%
She said, "Why have you never written about that?
About this 'white county' where you were raised?"

25
00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:85%
After Natasha asked me that question,
I started trying to see if I could use my education

26
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.277 align:middle line:85%
to find out the real story
of what had happened in 1912.

27
00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:56.741 align:middle line:85%
There was, in fact, in 1912,
a murder of a woman named Mae Crow.

28
00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:01.079 align:middle line:85%
And these two boys were hung for the crime.

29
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.665 align:middle line:85%
Five thousand white people came out
to celebrate the hanging

30
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.251 align:middle line:85%
as a kind of festival day, like a picnic.

31
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.838 align:middle line:85%
This had always been told to me
in kind of mythic terms,

32
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.841 align:middle line:85%
with the names and the dates and
the places stripped away.

33
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:85%
So I became interested not just in
the fact that this racial cleansing, this terror,

34
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.143 align:middle line:85%
had happened in my home place,
but that somehow, in 75 years,

35
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.812 align:middle line:85%
they had erased all sign that it ever occurred.

36
00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:85%
These children were part of the 1,098
black residents of Forsyth who fled.

37
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:35.697 align:middle line:85%
Over the course of about two months, 
the terrorist attacks --

38
00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:39.033 align:middle line:85%
arson, gunfire, lynching, and the threat of lynching --

39
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:43.288 align:middle line:85%
succeeded in driving out one-tenth of the population
of Forsyth County.

40
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:06.019 align:middle line:85%
The erasure of such places from the map of Forsyth was complete.

41
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.191 align:middle line:85%
Today, all that's left are a few scant details
about the dates on which churches were founded,

42
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.443 align:middle line:85%
lot numbers for the land on which they stood,

43
00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:17.363 align:middle line:85%
and the names of a handful of ministers
and worshippers who once gathered there.

44
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:23.912 align:middle line:85%
All over the county, beneath the ground on which
black churches stood, the soil is rich with ashes.

45
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.708 align:middle line:85%
When I went back to Cumming the first time
and stood on the corner

46
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:32.212 align:middle line:85%
where a man named Rob Edwards was lynched in 1912,

47
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:37.217 align:middle line:85%
My jaw just dropped because I had been 
researching this guy, 

48
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:43.223 align:middle line:85%
and he was part of the Democratic caucus
that really reversed all the gains of reconstruction.

49
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:47.685 align:middle line:85%
And on the corner where Rob Edwards was lynched,
there is a statue to him.

50
00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:50.688 align:middle line:85%
And this statue was erected in 2002.

51
00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:56.236 align:middle line:85%
So not only is there no sign on the land
of what happened to the black community there,

52
00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:85%
it has been really overwritten with this kind of thing.

53
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.578 align:middle line:85%
So that's kind of my argument, for people to do 
this work, to interrogate where they come from,

54
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:85%
to not take for granted the prosperity around you,

55
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.171 align:middle line:85%
that it got that way peacefully or justly.

56
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:85%
So, thank you guys so much for listening.
